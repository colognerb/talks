== Installation and Setup

Once you have extracted the files into the directory where you would like to
install Radiant:

1. Create the MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite/SQL Server/DB2 databases for your Web
   site. You only need to create the "production" database, but you may also
   want to create the "development" and "test" databases if you are developing
   extensions or running tests.

2. Edit config/database.yml to taste.  There are example files available for
   various databases in the config directory.

3. Run the database bootstrap rake task:
   
     % rake production db:bootstrap
   
   (If you would like bootstrap your development database run `rake
   development db:bootstrap`.)
   
   If you get the error "no such file to load -- spec/rake/spectask" please
   install Rspec (gem install rspec).

4. Start it like a normal Rails application. To test execute:
   
     % script/server -e production
   
   And open your Web browser on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000). The
   administrative interface is available at /admin/. By default the bootstrap
   rake task creates a user called "admin" with a password of "radiant".

When using Radiant on a production system you may also need to set permissions
on the public and cache directories so that your Web server can access those
directories with the user that it runs under.
